# QTreeGraphs
Tree:

Using value, Tree left, Tree right. 

Tree is a special Graph, so remember take advantage of BFS and DFS.

DFS using recurrsion, BFS using queue.


Binary Search Tree:

Delete: 
N1=node
NewNode=Min(N1.right)
NewNode.left=delMin(N1.right)
NewNode.right=N1.left

Random Node:

every deepth count the size, using Random() to give every node same change
